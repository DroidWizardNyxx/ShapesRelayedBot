# Shapes AI Discord Bot (Standalone)

This is a standalone Discord bot script powered by the [Shapes API](https://shapes.inc), with support for text, image, audio, and reasoning callbacks via an external relay system.

The bot connects to the relay hosted at:  
**[https://github.com/DroidWizardNyxx/ShapesRelay](https://github.com/DroidWizardNyxx/ShapesRelay)**
